Testing procedure:
  /clear/courses/comp421/pub/bin/mkyfs 4096
  /clear/courses/comp421/pub/bin/yalnix -ly 5 yfs
  /clear/courses/comp421/pub/bin/yalnix  -ly 5 yfs t/tcreate2

IMPORTANT: if at any point it gives an error that repeats through multiple test attempts,
  run mkyfs again. For example, Memory fault or Protection Violation.
IMPORTANT: if the test does not return with a graceful shutdown, you will need to control-c (and if that doesnt work perhaps mkyfs again.)
  
IMPORTANT: if it takes a long time to run, the test may not be correct directory or name
